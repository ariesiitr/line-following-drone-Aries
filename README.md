Line Following Drone

The Line Following Drone is an autonomous flying robot designed to follow a line on the ground using computer vision algorithms. It can be used for various applications such as warehouse automation, object tracking, and robotic competitions.

This project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for line tracking using a drone. 

Features
Autonomous line tracking: The drone uses computer vision algorithms to track and follow a line on the ground.
Customizable line detection: The line detection algorithm can be customized to adapt to different line colors and patterns.

Acknowledgments
The Line Following Drone project was inspired by the work of several researchers and open-source contributors in the field of autonomous drones.
We would like to thank the open-source community for their valuable contributions and support.
